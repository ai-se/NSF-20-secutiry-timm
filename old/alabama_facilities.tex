The Computer Science Department at the University of Alabama provides its faculty and graduate students with necessary equipment and computing to perform general research functions. 
This equipment includes dual-monitor desktop machines, data backup, networking services, web hosting, email, and printing facilities.
These computing resources are adequate for general research tasks including author documents, building webpages, and producing presentations.

These resources are supplemented at the college level by general computing labs (PC and Unix) that are available for all students. 
The Department also maintains its own computing laboratories with hardware and software that is specific to the needs of the discipline. 

The University provides access to the software resources necessary for this project including SPSS and NVivo.
The University also provides server space as needed for data processing and analysis.
