SAInT will help teams of SE researchers produced unbiased, repeatable, comprehensive SLRs.
These SLRs will increase the quality of SE research by helping researchers:
\vspace{-8pt}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Ground their research questions and experimental operationalizations in existing literature;
	\vspace{-8pt}
	\item Evaluate and synthesize literature to help identify best practices and empirically-grounded evidence that will benefit both researchers and practitioners; and
	\vspace{-4pt}
	\item Iteratively and periodically update the results of prior SLRs with new findings.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{-8pt}
As a result, development of SAInT will provide specific benefits to three CISE constituent communities, described in Section~\ref{sec:community:needs}.
Relative to those communities, the results of our CRI-P grant, described in Section~\ref{sec:planning:results}, establish the need for and requirements of SAInT.
%The following sections describe the community in need of the proposed infrastructure (Section~\ref{sec:community:needs}), the results from our previous work that identifies and enumerates the requirements for the proposed infrastructure (Section~\ref{sec:planning:results}), and how this infrastructure will enable new research (Section~\ref{sec:research:enabled}).
