NSF CCF-0915559 (PI: Kraft, Co-PI: Carver), (2009-present), Title: \emph{SHF: Small: Collaborative Research: Improved Code Clone Categorization}. In this project, PIs Kraft and Carver are developing and evaluating methods for categorizing code clone information to make it useful for developers. This project has supported the work of three graduate students. To date, this project has led to five workshop/conference~\cite{Beard_et_al:11}~\cite{Carver_et_al:11}~\cite{Chatterji_et_al:11}~\cite{Chatterji_et_al:10}~\cite{Chatterji_et_al:12} papers and two journal publications~\cite{Lukins_et_al:10}~\cite{Pate_et_al:11}.

NSF DUE-1154274 S-STEM: Increasing Diversity in Next Generation Computing and NSF DUE-0806929 IDIC: Increasing Diversity in Computing   (PI:Vrbsky, Co-PI: J Hale).  In these two awards, students within CS and MIS to increase the participation of students from underrepresented groups, including women and minority students, first-generation college students and students from economically challenged areas of Alabama.  The project establishes a formal structure for assessing and assisting students during their academic careers, including faculty, peer and alumni mentoring, and exposure to new advances in computing. As part of the broader impacts of this project, these students will learn about SLRs and assist in requirements definition.
