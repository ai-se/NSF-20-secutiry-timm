We have performed initial work to gather community needs and identify necessary characteristics and features for the infrastructure. Section~\ref{sec:prelim:needs} describes the community needs we have identified through our own experiences and our interactions with the community. Section~\ref{sec:prelim:tools} describes our current view of the infrastructure required to address the identified community needs.
