In this part we describe
the steps that we will take
to identify the consensus needs of the community,
to identify the major characteristics and features of the infrastructure, and
to foster community involvement in the planning process.
Specifically, Section~\ref{sec:needs} describes our plans
to supplement and improve the preliminary requirements
described in Section~\ref{sec:prelim:needs}
and to validate and prioritize the improved requirements. 
Further, Section~\ref{sec:tools} describes our plans
to update, supplement, and refine the infrastructure proposal described in Section~\ref{sec:prelim:tools}
and to prioritize the characteristics and features included in the infrastructure proposal. 

The general process we will follow in the remaining work is to first perform data collection and analysis, via surveys or literature reviews, then generate a proposal (of community needs or characteristics and features of the infrastructure), then interact with the community, via workshops and surveys, to gather feedback and evaluate our proposal. This process is iterative and will be repeated multiple times. Of the 15 tasks that constitute the remaining work,
6 tasks foster community involvement in the planning process via workshops and surveys, and
5 tasks implement changes to the requirements or to the infrastructure proposal
based on community input, feedback, and evaluation efforts.
