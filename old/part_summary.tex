\paragraph{Intellectual Merit}
Due to the criticality of literature reviews for various purposes, it is important that researchers be able to identify as complete a set of related literature as possible. 
This project will develop and deploy the type of infrastructure required to support this goal. 
Specifically, the resulting infrastructure will facilitate current and future research in that it will:
\vspace*{-4pt}
\begin{itemize*}
	\item Enable researchers to perform SLRs more easily by reducing the manual effort required and by improving the accuracy of the result; 
	\item Serve as a repository of all related literature about a research topic that can be kept current through the addition of newly published articles;
	\item Foster additional research by providing a repository of peer-reviewed data extraction sheets to the research community for exploration and use in meta-analysis; and
	\item Serve as a community hub to facilitate geographically distributed collaborations and to enable social networking regarding the results of SLRs
\end{itemize*}
\paragraph{Broader Impacts of Proposed Work}
By lowering the barriers to performing SLRs, the proposed infrastructure will:

\begin{itemize*}
	\item Enable the SE community to perform more SLRs;
	\item Ease the burden on new PhD students who conduct these reviews;
	\item Increase the prevalence of summarized results that can inform research and practice;
	\item Make the results of SLRs accessible to a larger audience; and
	\item Potentially address some of the medical community's SLR needs (See Section~\ref{sub:existing:tools}).
\end{itemize*}
\vspace*{-4pt}

In addition, because SLRs are often publishable in their own right, and because all PhD students must perform some type of literature review as part of their work, the proposed infrastructure will enable PhD students to obtain an additional publication in the course of their work.
CS and MIS students will be working together on this project.  
By building the tools to produce SLRs, they will be learning how to systematically search, cull, extract and synthesize SE research.  
This experience will be valuable as they progress in their careers.
