\caption{The top 7 terms in the 10 major SE topics
as found by AI text mining tools from 35,391 papers published at
major  conferences (MDLS, RE, ESEM, SSBSE, MSR, WCRE, ICPC, ICSM (ICSME), CSMR, ICSE, SANER, FSE, ASE, SCAm, GPCE, FASE) and major journals
(SOSYM, IEEE Software, REJ, SESE, SEM, SQJ, IST, ISSE, IJSEKE, NOTES, JSS, SOE, STVR, ASEJ, TSE, TOSEM)
in the period 1992 to 2016.
This table show just the top  seven terms in each cluster since there is an exponential drop in their frequency and ``knee'' of that curve occurs at terms=7. 
Topics are ordered top-to-bottom, most-to-least frequent. Also, terms within topics are ordered left-to-right most-to-least frequent. Topics are 
named using the most frequent terms. These topics cover 95\% of the papers studies by Mathew, Menzies et al.~\cite{Mathew_2018,mathewSoft18}.
