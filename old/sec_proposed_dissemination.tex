%We will employ various means of dissemination throughout the course of the project.
%Many of these have been mentioned earlier in the proposal.

First, we will provide intermediate (beta) versions of the infrastructure to our close collaborators.
Second, we will maintain a website providing project status, items in the feature backlogs, and SLR infrastructure feature testbed open for public reviews.
Third, we will conduct two workshops (described in Section~\ref{sec:proposed:evaluation}) to push information to the community.
Finally, we will document the capabilities and other important advances in conference (EASE and ESEM) and journal (IST and EMSE) papers.

Beyond the technical nature of the workshops, the workshops and conference presentations will aid in bringing members of the empirical SE research community together to discuss needs, barriers, solutions and achievements. 
This interaction will foster better research through the use of the proposed SLR infrastructure and ultimately assist in fostering its sustainability.
The workshops will provide us the opportunities to expand the community to include new authors and tool developers that can now leverage the completed infrastructure.
