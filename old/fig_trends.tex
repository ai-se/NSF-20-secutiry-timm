Arrows are used to highlight the major trends.
This is a {\em stacked} diagram where, for each year, the {\em most}
popular topic appears at the {\em bottom} of each stack. That is,
as topics become {\em more} frequent, they fall towards the {\em bottom} of the plot. Conversely, as topics become {\em less} frequent,
then rise towards the {\em top}.}\label{fig:topic_evo_conferences}
