Jeff, over to you.

just a suggestion, bit i think it is a non trivial exercise to define the output storage forms for the manual methods

i'm think that "headers for the excel spreadsheet" is thin edge of the wedge. i can imagine some v. complex yaml formats. and then we'll have to debug those formats running N uses cases to see what is incomplete in those formats

then we'll need demons to check if files written in those formats are correct

i say this is a big task cause i am fretful of a multi year data collection effort where in year3 we realzie we missed something important in year3 and the year1 data has to be thrown out
